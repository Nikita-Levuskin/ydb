# Installing Docker to work with {{ ydb-short-name }}

Before using the Docker image {{ ydb-short-name }}, you need to install and configure the Docker environment. To do this, you can use the official documentation:

- [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)
- [macOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
- [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)

Alternative installation methods like [colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) are also acceptable.

The installation of {{ ydb-short-name }} itself occurs at the [first launch](start.md).
